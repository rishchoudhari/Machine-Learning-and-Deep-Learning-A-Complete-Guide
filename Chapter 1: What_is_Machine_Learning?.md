# What is Machine Learning?

Tom Mitchell (1998) gives the following definition - 

"A computer program is said to <u>learn from Experience (E)</u> with respect some <u>Task (T)</u> and some <u>Performance Measure (P)</u>,
if its <u>performance on T, as masured by P, improves with experience E</u>."

Machine learning (ML) occurs at the intersection of 4 deisciplines of Mathematics.
<u>Linear Algebra</u>, <u>Calculus</u>, <u>Probability and Statistics</u>, and <u>Optimization</u>.

Those seeking to use ML in an <u>academic<u/> environment must be versed in <u>Python</u>.

Those seeking to use ML in a <u>production environment</u> must be versed in <u>JAVA, and C++</u>.

It is imperative to have a strong foundation in each of the four disciplnes of mathematics, along with the relevant programming language before proceeding further.
