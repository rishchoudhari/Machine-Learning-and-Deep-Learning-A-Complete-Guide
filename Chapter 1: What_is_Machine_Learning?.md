# What is Machine Learning?

Tom Mitchell (1998) gives the following definition - 

"A computer program is said to learn from Experience (E) with respect some Task (T) and some Performance Measure (P),
if its performance on T, as masured by P, improves with experience E."

Machine learning (ML) occurs at the intersection of 4 deisciplines of Mathematics.
Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics, and Optimization.

Those seeking to use ML in an academic environment must be versed in Python.

Those seeking to use ML in a production environment must be versed in JAVA, and C++.

It is imperative to have a strong foundation in each of the four disciplnes of mathematics, along with the relevant programming language before proceeding further.


## What is the Math used for?

Linear Algebra: Lets computers understand and manipulate data.

Calculus: Helps Models learn by adjusting parameters.

Probability and Statistics: Decision making under uncertainty.

Optimization: Find the best solution.

## Types of ML ##

Supervised Learning - The algorythm is trained on labeled data - the input (x) comes with a correct output (y) - so the model learns to predict right answer for new unseen data.

Unsupervised Learning - The algorythm analyzes unabled data, it discoveres structure (inputs, outputs, correct answers) on its own.

Resinforced Learning - The algorythm do whatever it wants and engineers reward success, and punish failure.
