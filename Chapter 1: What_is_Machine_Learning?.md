# What is Machine Learning?

Tom Mitchell (1998) gives the following definition - 

"A computer program is said to <b>learn from Experience (E)</b> with respect some <b>Task (T)</b> and some <b>Performance Measure (P)</b>,
if its <b>performance on T, as masured by P, improves with experience E</b>."

Machine learning (ML) occurs at the intersection of 4 deisciplines of Mathematics.
<b>Linear Algebra</b>, <b>Calculus</b>, <b>Probability and Statistics</b>, and <b>Optimization</b>.

Those seeking to use ML in an <b>academic<b/> environment must be versed in <b>Python</b>.

Those seeking to use ML in a <b>production environment</b> must be versed in <b>JAVA, and C++</b>.

It is imperative to have a strong foundation in each of the four disciplnes of mathematics, along with the relevant programming language before proceeding further.


## What is the Math used for?

<b>Linear Algebra</b>: Lets computers understand and manipulate data.

<b>Calculus</b>: Helps Models learn by adjusting parameters.

<b>Probability and Statistics</b>: Decision making under uncertainty.

<b>Optimization</b>: Find the best solution.
